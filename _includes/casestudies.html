			        <p class="card-text text-muted">The goal of the Utah Housing Community Cloud pilot is to help housing locators in the state of Utah reduce the time-to-housing for qualifying service recipients through interoperable data services and a more supportive application ecosystem across Utah’s network of state and local housing agencies and service providers.<br /><br />This pilot will leverage the best practices and current successes among network partners, to solve four data infrastructure challenges common across the network of housing services in the state: simplifying housing search, simplifying qualifying individual voucher and housing match, improving coordination of referrals and units across the network, and improving overall system performance views across multiple stakeholder.</p>
