                    Image optimization is one of the key factors of a slow-loading page. <br><br>
                    We know how to optimize the size and quality of existing images, and put in place automatic systems
                    for new uploads. When the shop is growing organic it becomes more complex and you pay with the
                    loading speed, we know what, and when to load, and customers will not wait for a loading function
                    that isn't in use.

                    We use our experience to start a new shop with the right steps. Sometimes it's the right way to
                    start all over but with lessons learned, instead of fixing grown dinosaurs. It pays back and doesn't
                    stop your sales in the meantime.
