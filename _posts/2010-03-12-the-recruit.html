<p class="MsoNormal">I finally convinced a friend to join Stephen and me in Mongol Rally! How did I overcome this poor victim&rsquo;s will and convince him to join us as we fumble our way through approximately twelve countries? I found the person most susceptible to my manipulations&mdash; a person whose sense of adventure rivals his common sense, a person who could not escape my zealous recruitment because he lives with me. The new recruit is&mdash; my law school housemate Tom!<&#47;p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tom finally committed to MMMT last night. We know he is invested heart and soul in Mongol Rally because he stayed up with Stephen and me until four A.M. planning our adventure! Tom will contribute boundless enthusiasm, skillful driving, limitless Reese&rsquo;s Peanut Butter Cups and hopefully a tent to our team! His bio will shortly follow!<&#47;p><&#47;p></p>
