<p>Day 33 in Dakhla.<&#47;p>
<p align="justify">I was pretty convinced that I&rsquo;d be back home sipping latte&rsquo;s and chomping on Chipolte chicken burritos in a temperature controlled office building by the end of the week. After the mechanic told us that the UPS package didn&rsquo;t solve the transmission problem, I figured I&rsquo;d give Hassan Monday to formally release the ambulance us complete with a certificate and cause of death. I was certain that he wasn&rsquo;t going to resolve this problem that we had been sitting on for a month by the end of Monday. The daily flight to Casablanca from Dakhla is 1110 Dirhams and a direct flight to New York from there runs for 6500 Dirham. I could fly out on Tuesday and get home by Thursday. Well, that all went out the window.<&#47;p>

<div style="width:448px;clear:both;font-size:.8em">Team Last Responders Ambulance returns from the mechanic<&#47;div><&#47;div><&#47;div> </p>
<p align="justify">Hassan phone us Monday evening to inform us that the ambulance was ready.&nbsp; As we walked over to his shop, the ambulance unexpectedly met us on the street. Hassan opened the driver side door, hopped out and with a big grin on his face offered me to test drive the car. Skeptical,&nbsp; I jumped in and took it down a stretch of road toward the beach. Now I&rsquo;ve driven the stretch before, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure it usually takes about 10 minutes. But with the flood of thoughts going through my mind, the drive felt like an hour.<&#47;p>
<p align="justify">The engine ran quieter, the drive was smoother, and the speedometer worked. Not only that, he <strong>washed<&#47;strong> the car, it&rsquo;s sparkling white (check out the photo below). No longer does our ambulance look, smell, sound like it&rsquo;s been through hell.&nbsp; It felt and looked like a new car. We returned in total shock and awe.<&#47;p>
<p align="justify">The feeling of being thrown back into the journey from the brink of buying that ticket home with one click is something I can&rsquo;t describe with words&hellip; I can only best describe the feeling as a strange mixture of excitement, disappointment, and confusion.<&#47;p>
<p>Time to clear our heads, stretch out our fingers, and get back on the saddle. Onward to Timbuktu.<&#47;p>
