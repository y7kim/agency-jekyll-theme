<p>Ever since returning from Mongolia, i&rsquo;ve been searching. I&rsquo;ve been searching for a reason to *not* take another cross continental ridiculous road trip. I&rsquo;ve been looking pretty hard. Top on the list of most people is that &ldquo;job&rdquo; thing. Okay people, yes jobs are important and we do need to earn a living somehow. But jobs and adventures are not mutually exclusive. So to put my money where my mouth is, I went ahead and got myself a full time job last fall, sought out the boss 2 months ago, and asked him:</p>
<p>Me: So boss, i got a question for ya</p>
<p>Boss: Okay shoot</p>
<p>Me: I want to take some time off, you know use my vacation days.</p>
<p>Boss: Yeah? okay no problem. When you thinking?</p>
<p>Me: This December</p>
<p>Boss: December? Wow that&rsquo;s about 7 months away. This is early notice!</p>
<p>Me: Yeah well&hellip;you know how we get 3 weeks?</p>
<p>Boss: Yeah?</p>
<p>Me: I want to take all of it once.</p>
<p>Boss: Woah! Well okay I guess that should be fine. They&rsquo;re your vacation days after all. Where you headed?</p>
<p>Me: Well I&rsquo;m planning to drive a car from London to Timbuktu</p>
<p>There you have it. Onward to Timbuktu.</p>
