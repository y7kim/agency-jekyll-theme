<p>On my 32nd birthday, December 14, 2011, I launched from JFK at 10:30PM for the Timbuktu Challenge. My brother Thomas dropped me off at the airport and my friend Daniel whom I&rsquo;ve known nearly 10 years was there send me off. He left me one line of advice: <&#47;p></p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re tired sleep, and when you&rsquo;re hungry eat.&rdquo;<&#47;p></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the line comes from somewhere, has a deep meaning somehow, and was credited to someone really really wise. Even though it sounds like one of those &ldquo;no shit&rdquo; pieces of advice, it&rsquo;s remarkable that I am remembering it now and will most likely repeat it to other people.<&#47;p></p>

<p>The most challenging task for this whole project was getting the car over to the start line. I&rsquo;ve heard accounts where ships get delayed by weeks and weeks. I&rsquo;ve heard stories where the EU slaps exorbitant fees on cars to leave the port. And if you&rsquo;ve seen The Wire, you&rsquo;d know that only bad things happen at the docks of Baltimore.<&#47;p></p>
<p>When Mike and Dennis reported yesterday from a rest stop that they received the ambulance in Liverpool and were on their way toward London, I was ecstatic. Okay the car didn&rsquo;t start when they got there but that doesn&rsquo;t count. Really. I&rsquo;m sure that the car will start when it really counts. But more importantly, they are on their way to meet the team at London, Heathrow, Terminal 4.<&#47;p></p>
