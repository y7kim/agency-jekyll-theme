<p>This morning, a man from Casablanca phoned Freya with news that the package was at the CTM bus station in Dakhla. Amazing! I could hardly believe it. Would it really be that simple?&#160; Would the package arrive on Wednesday when they said they would? <&#47;p>
<p>In a word, &ldquo;<strong>no<&#47;strong>&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p><em>At the package desk in the CTM bus station (pictured above)<&#47;em><&#47;p>
<p>Freya: &ldquo;Hi my name is Freya McCall, I&rsquo;m here to pick up a package&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Man: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a package for you&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Freya: &ldquo;It was put on a bus this Monday, it should be here&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Man: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have it, it&rsquo;s still in Casablanca.&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Freya: &ldquo;Impossible I received a phone call from Casablanca 3 minutes ago. They told me it&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Man: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not here&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p><em>We turn around, Freya phones Casablanca. <&#47;em><&#47;p>
<p>Casa Man: &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Freya: &ldquo;Hi. My name is Freya McCall. We just got a phone call from you informing us that our package has arrived. We&rsquo;re at the bus station and ---&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>[on hold]<&#47;p>
<p>Man: &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Freya: &ldquo;Hi. My name is Freya McCall. I&rsquo;m in Dakhla, and am expecting a package to arrive today. We got a phone call from you informing us that our package has arrived.&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Man: &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Freya: &ldquo;The package was supposed to arrive here in Dakhla today&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Man: &ldquo;Dakar?&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Freya: &ldquo;No Dakhla&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Man: &ldquo;Dakar?&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Freya: &ldquo;Dakhla, Daklha&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Man: &ldquo;Dakar?&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Freya: &ldquo;DAKHLA!&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>Man: &ldquo;Um&hellip;Dakar?&rdquo;<&#47;p>
<p>[heated exchange]<&#47;p>
<p><em>Freya hands the phone to the package man.<&#47;em><&#47;p>
<p><em>Package man and Casablanca Man go back and forth in French&#47;Arabic.<&#47;em><&#47;p>
<p>Package Man: The package is in Casablanca.&#160; They&rsquo;ll put it on today&rsquo;s bus and it&rsquo;ll get here in 2 days, Friday.<&#47;p>
<p>So there you have it folks. Friday. Thanks Morocco.<&#47;p></p>
