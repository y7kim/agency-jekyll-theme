<p>Here&#8217;s is the third installment of the team&#8217;s injury report. Stephen  was in D.C. over the past weekend and a few days this week. He is in  great shape as he fenced in a fencing tournament in College Park,  Maryland. Stephen will fence in a national tournament again this weekend  in Virginia Beach, VA. Accordingly, he is in fantastic shape.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Judy is busy getting her equestrian on, riding horses once or twice a  week. She has been in good health this week since recovering from her  mild sickness. Judith also stays busy going to the gym and will possibly  take up hot yoga and ballroom, plus swing, dancing this summer along  with Tom.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Tom, on the other hand, has much to report on the injury front. Tom  will be required to remain a relatively (for him) sedentary individual  for the foreseeable future as he recovers from his rhinoplasty nose  surgery. Tom&#8217;s surgery last week was a success. His nose is now  straight, and he can finally breathe through both nostrils again.  Although sore, tender, and a little swollen still, Tom&#8217;s taped-up nose  is better than ever. He got the interior splints and stitches removed  today by the nose surgeon. The Reese&#8217;s man (a shipment of two large  boxes came in just last week) is off the percocet and other pain killers  now, only daily taking ultra-strength tylenol and anti-biotics. During  today&#8217;s appt, the doctor told Tom to refrain from playing tennis,  swimming, running, or lifting weights for the next four weeks or so and  to refrain from basketball for eight weeks. Tom will be taking email  suggestions for new, non-strenuous but possibly healthy exercises to  take up his time in between studying for finals and applying for summer  externships.. tomdorwart@gmail.com<&#47;p></p>
<p>Tom also had a follow-up appointment with a separate doctor for his  recent bronchitis bout. The pugilistic disease has not yet left Tom, as  Tom continues to lose his meals every once in a while after post-meal  coughing. Tom will see a gastrologist and have a scope examination to  make sure everything is okay down there.. he had blood tests and urine  samples earlier this week as well and anxiously but hopefully awaits the  results. Tom is now taking an anti-acid reflux prescription medicine.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Lastly, Tom will also see a neurosurgeon to check his beleaguered  neck. In high school, your Reese&#8217;s dude dislocated his C1-C2 vertebrae  and had fusion surgery in which doctors shaved bone from his hip to  place in his neck. The nose surgeon and anesthesiologist said Tom&#8217;s  reflexes were a little off, so a checkup and MRI are in store. no  worries followers&#8230; hopefully all is well on the injury front.<&#47;p></p>
<p>If everything turns out fine from the nose surgeon, the gastrologist,  and the neurosurgeon, Tom will just be all the more thoroughly examined  before Mongol Rally. So you can rest assured, that if&#47;when&#47;as soon as  Tom is cleared, he will certainly be hitting the gym and basketball  courts again (fitted nose mask and all) and will be ready for a healthy  and safe trip to Mongolia.<&#47;p></p>
<p>stay healthy followers,<&#47;p></p>
