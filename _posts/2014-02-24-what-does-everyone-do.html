<p>When 6 people travel in a pack, group dynamics is a fun thing in it self.&nbsp; Each one us came from different background with distinct personalities, we all have diverse reactions to emergencies on the road.</p>
<p>After we crossed the Mexico-Guatemala border, on the mountainous descent to Lake Atitlan, Steve was driving the ambulance while Mike was navigating for him.&nbsp; Martha was lying on the bench, and I was sitting in the back of the ambulance with her.</p>
<p>Northing was going on for a while, then Martha broke the long silence, &ldquo;What is that smell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burning of rubber, brake pads must be burning hot.&rdquo; I casually replied.</p>
<p>Although Martha doesn&rsquo;t drive, she processes a normal sense of logic and reasoning. She paused for half a minute, perhaps waiting for me to come to reason, but she got no response.&nbsp; &ldquo;This smell is intense, it seems to be bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; Martha tried to enlighten me.</p>
<p>I turned to the front of the ambulance and told Steve to stop&nbsp; the car to let the brakes&nbsp; cool off.&nbsp; He used the walkie-talkie to tell our supporting vehicle the Jeep to stop as well, we had to park the vehicles on the shoulder of a curve.&nbsp; As soon as we stepped out of the vehicles, we saw white smoke coming out of all wheels of the ambulance and the front wheels of the Jeep.&nbsp; Everybody was shocked by this intense situation for a minute of two, then we all went on our own ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve started calling our mechanic friend from New Jersey.&nbsp; The cell signal was pretty bad, so it took him almost 10 minutes to get through the international call.&nbsp; During this time, Stephen Alexis marched forward to check the road condition ahead.&nbsp; When Stephen Alexis returned with the news that we got at least of half a mile of downhill, Steve was still trying to get the call through.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stephen Alexis looked up and decided not to join Martha and Mike who climbed high above and started a deep philosophical conversation.</p>

<p>Paul pulled out his iPad and continued to read the New York Times he downloaded two days ago when we had Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hesitated in joining&nbsp; Mike and Martha up there because I was wearing flip flops.&nbsp; I also couldn&rsquo;t bother Steve since he was on the phone, in boredom, I took over-exposed pictures of everybody and zoomed in on this plant on the cliff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody panicked, we all remained pretty cool in this heated situation.&nbsp; Half an hour later, we continued our journey to San Marcos with the advice from New Jersey to shift down to lower gear instead of braking all the time.&nbsp; All was well.</p>
