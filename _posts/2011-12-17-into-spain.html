<p><em>Monday Morning, 12&#47;19&#47;11<&#47;em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-818" title="Hello, Spain" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.lastresponders.org&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;12&#47;first-spain.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="auto" &#47;></p>
<p>Yesterday I woke up in Spain. I had actually gotten what you could consider to be a full night's sleep, though it was on the ambulance's bench seat with my camera bag for a pillow. We had driven though the night, and apparently I'd slept through a major snow storm in the Pyrenees. But as I stepped out of the ambulance somewhere near 11am the sun was shining and the temperature was a bit higher then I'd gotten accustomed to. I would've never believed that while I slept the others actually considered putting the snow chains on the tires.</p>

<p>My introduction to Spain was at a middle of nowhere gas station. Even so, the surrounding landscape was impressive, its color palette entirely new to me. With a clear blue sky and rolling green hills, shades of orange pervaded everything. A bell tower rose out of a tiny hamlet in the distance, and the crack of a rifle echoed in the sky, from a hunter within sight of the highway.</p>
<p>Another thing I learned about Spain is that giant legs of cured ham can be found at any gas station.<br />

<p>It seems like we've been getting most of the driving done at night, but the nights are long and the days are short. The sun comes up after 8 and starts to disappear after 4. Our timing is all off&hellip; Just as in Paris, last night we rolled into Seville under cover of night, only to hit a few landmarks and be back on the road. Hopefully the rush through Europe will make for a more leisurely drive through Africa. We arrived in Tarifa at around 5am, and had a room waiting for us. It's actually a pretty nice looking place, and to see all the other rally cars parked out front in a row gives us a renewed sense of a journey just beginning.</p>
