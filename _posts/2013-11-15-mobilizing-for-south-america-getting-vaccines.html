<p>Bolivia is the only country on our route to require visa for Americans, and yellow fever vaccine is required as part of the Bolivian visa application. &nbsp;The last time I got vaccines was in high school, I had to get TB because I was working in a nursing home, an environment full of weak immune systems. &nbsp;It would be a good idea to get vaccines for our long travel. &nbsp;As Ken stated, we want to die doing wild stuff on our adventure, &nbsp;we don't want to be killed by preventable diseases.</p>
<p>After more than an hour of wait at the Beth Israel Medical Center, I got to see Dr Salomon who specializes in travel medicine.&nbsp; While I was waiting, I kept on wondering if I got see the doctor at 13:36 for a 12:00 appointment, what would happen to the 13:00 appointment, what about 14:00 appointment, and the next one, and the next one...&nbsp; Well, anyhow, the doctor advised me to drink bottled water only, stay away from animals and street food, use hand sanitizer with more than 60% of rubbing alcohol, and educated me on the following:</p>
<p><strong>Diarrhea<&#47;strong> is the most common travel related sickness.&nbsp; It should be treated as:</p>
<ul>
<li>day 1: use Imodium (2mg) after each loose stools up to 4 times a day, stay hydrated with salty water<&#47;li>
<li>day 2: if symptoms improved, continue Imodium and hydration until diarrhea subsides (at this point I said, I never had diarrhea more than 2 days)<&#47;li>
<li>day 3: if diarrhea continues, start taking antibiotic Ciprofloxain - up to twice a day for no more than 3 days<&#47;li>
<li>day 5: visit a doctor if still having symptoms<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<strong>Dengue<&#47;strong> is the most common virus carried by mosquito, followed by <strong>malaria<&#47;strong> and <strong>yellow fever<&#47;strong>. &nbsp; Strangely, after writing down this statement on a piece of paper, the doctor only prescribed preventive treatments for malaria and yellow fever, he did not mention another word about how to prevent dengue...&nbsp; For the record, Dr Salmon said to use mosquito repellent containing 30-50% DEET, such mosquito repellent can be found at camping stores, and mosquito repellent should only be applied on exposed skin for outdoors and must be washed off each night.&nbsp; I wanted to tell the doctor that we might not be able to shower everyday but decided to hold my tongue.</p>
<p><strong>Different Malaria Treatment in Latin America<&#47;strong> - The malaria virus in South America countries such as Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela developed&nbsp;chloroquine resistance, so malarone is to be taken once a day.&nbsp; In Panama, Costa Rica, rural regions of Bolivia below 2500 meters,<strong>&nbsp;<&#47;strong>Guatemala out side of the capital, and Mexico,&nbsp;chloroquine is to be taken once a week.&nbsp; I was advised to start taking chloroquine one week before entering Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Hepatitis A, yellow fever, typhoid, and Tdap vaccines<&#47;strong> were prescribed to me, I was told to get the <strong>second shot of Hepatitis A vaccine 6 months later<&#47;strong>.&nbsp; When I took the prescriptions to the nurse, the nurse asked if I wanted to get all of them at once.&nbsp; I asked if these are conflicting vaccines, to which she replied n0, so I sat down, pulled up a sleeve and took out my beloved phone to continue my horse racing game while she prepared for all the shots.&nbsp; When the nurse got ready, she hid 4 Sharon needles under a sheet of tissue paper with one hand while trying to rub my arm with an alcohol pad using the other hand.&nbsp; I was very very puzzled, and I asked why she was covering the Sharon needles.&nbsp; She smiled and said that she was afraid that I would be nervous.&nbsp; I smiled back and said no, I have no reason to be nervous. I thought maybe this nurse was new, so I looked at my arm to make sure she's not poking me too many times, then smiled at her the entire time to comfort her.&nbsp; When she finished, she told me that I'm much more relax than the average bear.&nbsp; Once again, I was shocked, I'm an adult, I'm not 6 years old, why would I be afraid of 4 tiny little Sharon needles?&nbsp; She said that some adults ask to lie down while taking vaccine shots.&nbsp; Well, alright, I was in a hospital, maybe this nurse is used to patients with mental sickness.&nbsp; I smiled and nodded, then quickly returned to my workplace.</p>
