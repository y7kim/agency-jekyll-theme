<p align="justify">Compared to Nioro Hotel Customs, the Bamako Hotel Plage was a completely different planet. Not even the daily trash burning next door changed my opinion that this was absolute paradise. Our rooms had electricity, air conditioning, and hot running water - something I hadn&rsquo;t seen since Rabat. The hotel offered wifi, a spectacular view of the Niger River and, best of all, Italian food prepared by real Italians. The Salif Keita Foundation had generously prepared these accommodations for us and I must say that I'm really thankful. I&rsquo;m also glad to report that I took my first modern shower in Africa. That&rsquo;s right, I hadn&rsquo;t taken a shower since December 20th, 2011, Tarifa. The black water streaming down the shower drain was pretty impressive.<&#47;p>

<p align="justify">I had hoped that all the paperwork would get sorted out on Monday as cited on Friday, but deep down I knew it wasn&rsquo;t going to happen. I have yet to see bureaucracy in Africa get anything done in a timely fashion.&#160; We sat around the hotel Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday waiting for news that we were good to go back to Nioro. It&rsquo;s amazing how every step forward&#160; seemed to reveal a new arbitrary complication. This was all mind boggling frustrating, but at least we weren&rsquo;t waiting at Niroro.<br />

<p align="justify">Thursday morning we received the shocking news that we were good to go and a car had been prepared for us. After all we&rsquo;ve been through, good news was hard to swallow. The drive back to Nioro was a completely different experience from the drive down on Feb 10. First of all, the car was a 4x4 Toyota HiLux. Secondly, the car wasn&rsquo;t held together with rope and rubber cement. Thirdly, the car was equipped with air-conditioning. And finally, everything was prepaid. We didn&rsquo;t have to wonder whether we were getting ripped off by some insidious coalition of Malian taxi drivers bent on squeezing every last dime out of foreign travelers. &#160; Amazingly, the drive was actually uneventful &ndash; no car switching, no break down, no stopping to check up on the car&rsquo;s engine. Not only that, it took half the amount of time it took to come down. We departed Bamako at 1:30 and arrived at 6:30, a mere 5 hours as compared to 10 hours - amazing.<&#47;p>
<p>At 6:30 PM, February 16, 2012, Team Last Responders reunited with the&#160; ambulance at Nioro, stamped customs paper in hand.<&#47;p>
