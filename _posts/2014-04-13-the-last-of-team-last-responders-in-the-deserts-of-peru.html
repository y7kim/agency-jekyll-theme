<p><span style="color: #0000ff">T<span style="font-size: medium">hree out of seven members of Team Last Responders remained together after Trujillo, Peru.&nbsp; Ken left months ago in Mexico City; in Trujillo, Stephen Alexis went on his speed travel to Patagonia, Mike and Paul retuned home, with no answers on how <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.viveperu.org&#47;">Vive Peru<&#47;a> would receive the donation of the vehicles, Martha, Steve, and Cathy continued to travel to Bolivia.&nbsp; We plan to visit <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.esperanca.org&#47;">Esperanca<&#47;a> in Bolivia while <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.viveperu.org&#47;">Vive Peru<&#47;a> sorts out the donation process. As the team headed out of Trujillo, Martha wanted to put the extra Jeep keys on her keychain, forgetting that we left the Jeep behind; when entering a crowded city, Cathy looked into the side mirror of the ambulance to see whether the Jeep was following, also forgetting the Jeep was no longer there; Steve, well, Steve has been focusing on an iPhone game and has not yet had the leisure to express his emotions.<&#47;span><&#47;span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: Comic Sans MS;font-size: medium">Description &ndash; This woman works diligently around the clock to produce content for the team.&nbsp; She spends hours everyday taking pictures, selecting pictures, and editing videos.&nbsp; Since Mike&rsquo;s departure, this poor woman&rsquo;s work increased tremendously, she had to climb up a tower to take photos with 2 film cameras and 3 digital cameras while her teammates sat around and poked each other in boredom.&nbsp; Without her, the South America journey would be unimaginable if not impossible.<&#47;span></p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;font-family: Comic Sans MS;font-size: medium">Description &ndash; This man is known to go on rallies delivering ambulances to charities around the world.&nbsp; He enjoys challenges and loves to tell rally stories.&nbsp; His daily tasks are: setting goals for the team, driving, writing emails and blog posts, and tolerating Cathy&rsquo;s endless nagging. While most of his teammates regard him as a good leader, it should also be known that on the rally, he rarely showers, never washes his clothes, and <span style="text-decoration: line-through">h<&#47;span>as very stinky feet.<&#47;span></p>
