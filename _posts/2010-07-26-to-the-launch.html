After securing our third team member 12 hours late, we were hungry,
exhausted and the lacking in British pounds effectively made us broke.
Nonetheless we began dragging ourselves toward the next checkpoint on our
mission: goodwood racetrack. We made a rest stop south of gatwick at Brighton,
a beautiful town along the southern english coast. But after losing all my
possessions, I was feeling pretty damn low and not in the best mood to enjoy
much of anything.. To top it all off, the meal of the day, chicken doner,
tasted pretty terrible.

We headed west from Brighton toward goodwood but had very little idea where
exactly this place was. Our macroview map book of the area offered little help
to us navigating through the winding streets of the English country side.

Looking for the campsite turned out to be a nightmare. Although only 20 miles
away, by the time we were on the road, darkness had settled in. Making signs
reading difficult.

We asked for directions from  several people, each one remarked at how far off
the mark we were. We did our best to follow vague directions through the British
 countryside maze but as one hour turned to two and three, the exhausted team
 slowly grew  frustrated.  Eventually we found ourselves being stopped by blue
 lights. Being the one sitting in the back i shouted ahead: &ldquo;hey guys
 we&rsquo;re getting pulled over.&rdquo;  We all froze in our seats, not
 knowing what to expect. The british officer came up to the driver side window
 and said in his British English:

I noticed that you were driving really slowly and weaving a bit. I wanted to
check you guys to see what was going in. Whew it seems like Brit cops are polite
and helpful. We werent drunk but we were closely deliriously exhausted. We
explained to him what we&rsquo;re trying to do. he gave us some directions and
took off. Uneventful , a good thing when cops are in the story. If a cop stops
you in new york you&rsquo;re looking at some fine or ticket to help full the
empty nyc coffers.

After four roundabouts we saw welcoming signs pointing us toward the mongol
rally campsite. But as we followed the signs, they disappeared leaving us once
again lost winding around in circles. At one point we found ourselves on the
wrong aide of the road. A good sameritain noticed our weird car and pull up
along side us to ask if we realized that in England you drive on the right
side. The man was apparently German, and he noticed the German plates. Lillie
explain to him where we were headed and he offered to take us to goodwood.
Mighty helpful. We followed him for about 5 minutes until a fiat ambulance
decked out with jerry cans mounted to the roof  passed us by in the other
direction. Team magical Mongolian mystery tour has made first contact with
nomad feet. They offered to lead us to the camp site. We followed them like
following a magical fairy to the magical corner of the forests where all the
magical animals grazed.

And what an awesome field it was. Its not every day you see so many pimped out
ambulances, firetrucks, and under powered tiny cars. It was time to celebrate
with some rest!
