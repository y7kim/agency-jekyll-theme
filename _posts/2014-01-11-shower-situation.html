<p>Shower situation is a common question among our friends at home as well as new acquaintances we meet on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we launched, Steve and Kunal said that on the previous rally, as long as everyone stinks, nobody would notice and nobody would care.&nbsp; The first 3000 miles of our journey was in the US, where shower had been available almost everyday.&nbsp; Since we left the Reali&rsquo;s family, we slept inside the ambulance in Tucson for 2 nights then again in the ambulance at the Mexican border control, the fourth night, we checked in to a motel named Faraon in Hermosillo with hot water and shower facility.&nbsp; At this point, I have many bloody stretch marks on my limbs because I have been itchy all over.&nbsp; Somehow, Martha magically maintained her long silky hair to be neat and pretty.&nbsp; Steve has not changed his underwear for more than a week, well, with the exception of his socks, I put them in the laundry 4 days ago.&nbsp; Mike, Stephen Alexis, and Ken are not often under my detailed examination, so they all appeared normal.</p>
<p>Everyone showered and put on clean lingerie except for Steve.&nbsp; I tried to pursue him in many ways, I offered to be extra nice, I offered to make his instant noodles, I threatened him that I&rsquo;ll be very mean if he doesn&rsquo;t comply, I cursed and even told him to sleep with Stephen Alexis, but all my efforts were fruitlessly&hellip; Steve simply twiddled his extremely stinky toes towards me to chase me away&hellip;</p>
<p>Last night, after my super comfortable hot shower, I layered on soy honey and milk whipped body butter, then slept in the same bed as this guy who dogmatically refused to change his clothes or take shower.&nbsp; The next morning, I forgot about being mean, I made him coffee.&nbsp; As I filtered boiling water through the coffee beans, I noticed a funny non-coffee smell.&nbsp; The water vapor ran through my fingers and palm and aroused this mixture of Steve&rsquo;s unbearable odor and my lotion.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t despaired when we found out some paperwork would take 12 weeks long, I wasn&rsquo;t down when the ambulance was broken for days, but at that moment, I felt so defeated.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m gonna plan a revenge, our journey is still long, I have plenty of time to think.</p>
