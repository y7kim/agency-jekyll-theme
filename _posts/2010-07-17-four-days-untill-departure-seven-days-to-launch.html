<p>The clock is ticking, minutes and hours are winding away inching us closer to the departure. My flight out of New York is this coming Wednesday and the amount to do before then is immense. Since our last post, we&#8217;ve managed to finally purchase <strong>and<&#47;strong> register our vehicle!<&#47;p></p>

<p>Meanwhile my teammates in DC are scrambling to finish assignments and papers before they leave next week. Personally, I am going to preparation and planning overdrive. I&#8217;ve reviewed our route and drawn up several lists of equipment, printing documents, gathering information, reasearch.<&#47;p></p>
<p>In other news, I took Gold this summer at 2 of the 3 events: Div 1A Men&#8217;s foil, and Senior Team foil. Go Team Magical Mongolian Mystery Tour!<&#47;p></p>
<p>For those of you that are local in New York, we have a launch party tonight!<&#47;p></p>
